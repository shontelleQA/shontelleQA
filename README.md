I break things on purpose. Then I write about it.

I’m a career-changer turned QA Analyst with deep roots in healthcare ops and compliance. I test like a user *and* a detective — validating backend logic, uncovering edge cases, and documenting everything like someone’s audit depends on it (because sometimes, it does).  

Currently blending QA testing with a growing focus on **data validation** and **Python automation** — one portfolio project at a time.

### 💼 What I’m Building + Refining

- 🔍 Running QA cycles end-to-end — writing, executing, and improving test cases across real apps
- 🧪 Dialing in API test strategies with Postman — chaining requests, validating edge cases, and working with auth tokens
- 🧵 Expanding Selenium + Pytest coverage — creating modular test flows and experimenting with automation patterns
- 📊 Validating backend logic with SQL — using joins, filters, and exploratory queries to catch data mismatches early
 - 📈 Exploring data analytics concepts through hands-on projects — using Python, spreadsheets, and dashboards to surface insights from messy data
- ✍🏽 Turning all of it into teachable moments at [Test Like A Girl](https://testlikeagirl.com) — because documenting *how* I think is part of my process
