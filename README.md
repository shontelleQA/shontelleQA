**Healthcare Data Analyst | Claims Analytics & Data Quality**

I analyze healthcare data with a quality-first mindset, specializing in claims analytics, denial patterns, and cost drivers.
My background in healthcare operations and QA means I don't just surface insights — I validate the data behind them first.  

🔍 *Good analytics starts with good data.*

📍 Based in Virginia | Healthcare-focused | Open to remote  
📝 Writing & documenting at [Test Like A Girl](https://testlikeagirl.com)

I’m deepening my data analytics practice while leveraging a strong foundation in quality engineering and healthcare operations. 

**What I'm building:**
- Healthcare claims data quality analysis with SQL and Power BI
- Data validation and integrity checking skills
- Understanding of medical economics and denial patterns
- Portfolio that connects data quality rigor with analytical insight

QA isn’t my title — it’s the discipline that informs how I analyze data.

| 🩺 **Healthcare Data Quality & Claims Analytics** | **[data-healthcare-analytics-suite](https://github.com/shontelleQA/data-healthcare-analytics-suite)** *(In Progress)* | Healthcare data quality analysis and claims-style analytics, including SQL profiling, reconciliation logic, integrity checks, and Power BI dashboards focused on cost, utilization, and data completeness | SQL · Power BI · Python · Excel |

> This repository demonstrates my quality-first approach to healthcare data analytics. Work focuses on understanding source data structure, validating assumptions, identifying data limitations, and translating trusted findings into clear, defensible business insights.

*Additional healthcare analytics case studies (e.g., medical cost analysis, utilization trends, prior authorization patterns) will be added as the repository evolves.*
