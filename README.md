I break things on purpose. Then I write about it.

I’m a career-changer turned QA Analyst with deep roots in healthcare ops and compliance. I test like a user *and* a detective — validating backend logic, uncovering edge cases, and documenting everything like someone’s audit depends on it (because sometimes, it does).  

Right now, I’m building a full QA-to-Data validation stack:
testing what users see, what APIs do, and what databases keep.

## 🧩 My QA → Data Validation Stack

*(What I’m building & refining:)*  
- Expanding a modular Selenium + PyTest framework for end-to-end coverage  
- Automating API and database validations using PyTest + Qase  
- Designing an ETL QA pipeline with synthetic healthcare data and masking logic  
- Documenting my full build process through [TestLikeAGirl.com](https://testlikeagirl.com)


| Layer | Repository | Focus | Tools |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **🧠 UI + Functional Automation** | [QA Automation (Selenium + Python)](https://github.com/shontelleQA/qa-automation-python-selenium-ecommerce) | E-commerce UI automation framework validating functional workflows and checkout logic | Selenium · PyTest · Page Object Model |
| **🔗 API + Database Validation** | [QA End-to-End Systems Suite](https://github.com/shontelleQA/qa-end-to-end) | Integrated test suite combining manual, API, and SQL validation — bridging UI events and backend data | Postman · PyTest · SQL · TestRail |
| **🧮 Data Pipeline + ETL QA** | [Healthcare Data QA](https://github.com/shontelleQA/healthcare-data-qa) *(in progress)* | Synthetic healthcare pipeline with ETL verification, masking, and CI/CD | FastAPI · SQLite · Pandas · GitHub Actions |


> Together, these projects simulate a real enterprise QA environment — validating how data moves from the front end all the way through backend systems and pipelines.
