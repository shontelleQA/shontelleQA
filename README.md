**Software QA Engineer → Data Analyst | Healthcare & Systems QA**

I’m Nicole, a QA Analyst and data storyteller with a background in healthcare operations and compliance.  
I build frameworks, pipelines, and dashboards that make data more trustworthy — testing what users see, what APIs do, and what databases keep.  

QA Analyst • Documentation Nerd • Data Seeker • Builder of [Test Like A Girl](https://testlikeagirl.com)  
📍 Based in Virginia | Writing, testing, and occasionally breaking things on purpose.

My work sits at the intersection of **Quality Assurance** and **Data Analytics** where defect patterns become data stories, and validation turns into insight.  

Right now, I’m building a full QA-to-Data validation stack that connects front-end behavior, backend APIs, and data pipelines.

*(What I’m building & refining:)*  
- Expanding a modular Selenium + PyTest framework for end-to-end coverage  
- Automating API and database validations using PyTest + Qase  
- Designing an ETL QA pipeline with synthetic healthcare data and masking logic  
- Documenting my full build process through [TestLikeAGirl.com](https://testlikeagirl.com)


| Layer | Repository | Focus | Tools |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **🧠 UI + Functional Automation** | **[qa-automation-framework-ecommerce](https://github.com/shontelleQA/qa-automation-framework-ecommerce)** | E-commerce UI automation framework validating functional workflows and checkout logic | Selenium · PyTest · Page Object Model |
| **🔗 API + Database Validation** | **[qa-api-integration-suite](https://github.com/shontelleQA/qa-api-integration-suite)** | Integrated test suite combining manual, API, and SQL validation — bridging UI events and backend data | Postman · PyTest · SQL · TestRail |
| **🧮 Data Pipeline + ETL QA** | **[qa-healthcare-data-validation](https://github.com/shontelleQA/qa-healthcare-data-validation)** | Synthetic healthcare pipeline with ETL verification, masking, and CI/CD | FastAPI · SQLite · Pandas · GitHub Actions |


> Together, these projects simulate a real enterprise QA environment — validating how data moves from the front end all the way through backend systems and pipelines.
